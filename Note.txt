Typescript  is a superset of javascript : which simpley means , a wrapper or layer with more features


Somme Typescript features:
1. Types - Tells our program what kind of data it should expect
2. Interfaces - Defines how our data or functionalities should be modeled.
3. Decorators  - This are functions that are invoked with a prefied @ symbol . They return the same thing that was passed in, but it has been argument in some way
Note: for decorators you can decorator anything (Classses, methods ,properties and parameters)



TYPES

let name : string; // this shows we are expecting a value of string here
 
 Types
 1. number - intergers
 2. string - text
 3. boolean - true / false
 4. any - all 

Examples :

1. let isDone: boolean = true;
2. let decimal : number = 20;
3. let name : string = "Syntax Designer";
4. let posts: number[] = [1,2,3,4] // array of number;
5. let notSure: any = 'Hi'; //anything



INTERFACES

    interface Post{
        title : string;
    }


DECORATORS

    @Component()


RUNNING TYPESCRIPT
1. tsc filename.ts  > this generates a filename.js file with the js formate of the code
2. tsc filename.ts -w  > this will watch the file and re-run the tsc compiler when the file is changed



Type Inference - this is the ability of typescript to detect type errors in our code
